## Social Media History

I've been pretty active on social media for about the last 15 years or so. MySpace was around when I was in high school, but I never had an account. I thought it was kind of weird and didn't seem like something I needed. Facebook started popping up around the time I graduated. Some of my friends showed it to me, but I didn't see the appeal. Fast forward a few years and I was 21. I had just returned from living abroad in Mexico and had a strong desire to connect with people I had met there, as well as former friends, classmates, and coworkers. So I created an account and was having fun reconnecting with people.

Shortly after, ~~Twitter~~ ~~X~~ Twitter started to come to my attention. I was intrigued by the brevity of Tweets at that time (120 characters) and the ability to interact with celebrities or other famous people. I created an account and followed notable people in all sorts of communities.

A few years later in the college/newly married era, I created an Instagram account. I was intrigued by the ability to post artistic photos to tell a story to my followers. I also started making the most unique hashtags ever known to man.
